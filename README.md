----------------
Explanations
| Quorix shitshow ( owner of it is apparently a skid, he said i skidded vatos joiner , restore cord bypasser , other bypasses and reactor while the code is legit not the same , i also | havent fully skidded bloody, i have been updating it and made it better, more up to date, deadly raider was not skidded from GANG Nuker and will never be , he also said i ve used 
| subprocess and yes thats right but he also used it... and he said that i used his old auth from 2021 while he made it in 2024 with gpt ofc and allowed me to use it...
